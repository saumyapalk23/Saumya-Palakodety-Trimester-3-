**_5.1-5.6 Study Notes_**

**5.1 Video Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Effects**
* WII and iPhone
* * WII before iPhone
* * Both have accelerometers, in development for same periods of time
* * Accelerometer part of automotive industry → airbags when too fast; prevents injury
* * Quadcopter: brain w a sense, accelerometer
* Ppl complete tasks by changing things through innovation
* Miltirotor
* * Benefits: deliveries, finding ppl, easy photography
* * Harmful: flying in unreg. zones, illegal/dangerous, privacy concerns
* WII
* * Controller: gets ppl active
* * Harmful: broken tv’s, injuries
* Not every effect of innovation anticipated
* Effects of comp innovation are dangerous/beneficial at the same time, to many ppl or same person even
* Ppl create computing innovations (3d printers)
* Advances in computing generated creativity in other fields
* LOOK AT FLOWCHARTS! Assume anything will work unless stated otherwise

**Beneficial and Harmful Effects.2**

* Comp innovation can impact beyond purpose
* Ex: internet was beneficial, now ppl spend more time on internet than sleep
* * Dopamine feedback loops → like, comment, etc: happier
* * Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
* * Tiktok PSA lol!
Computing innovations used in ways that are unintended; programmers try to consider these ways and potential benefits/harms
Microtransactions
* Little payments for cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay to win, etc.
* Comp innovations may harm society, economy, culture
* Impossible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation is used
* Rapid sharing of a program results in impacts beyond intended purpose/control


**5.2 Video Notes: Digital Divide**

* Issues that contribute to divide
* Internet access varies bw all areas
* Divide → differing access
* Socioeconomic: how much money comes into house each yr
* Geographic: live  w not that many ppl; no Internet
* Demographics (Age, Religion) → less likely to have these things
* Countries: computers not common in rural areas, small # of websites, internet to protect/advocate govt, high surveillance to protect govt.
* Digital divide affects grps, individuals, raises issues, affected by actions of orgs, individuals, etc.

**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:**

**Beneficial**

i. Beneficial effects of computing include enhanced tech advances that can aid us in our educational experiences, by being able to use services such as IntelliJ and the internet when necessary.

ii. We can create websites or other online platforms that help students or even adults around the world.

iii. Tech is also a great time-saver. It definitely helps with efficiency as we’re can definitely use it in our daily activities, instead of doing things in an older way.

**Disadvantageous**

i. Tech can be harmful because of social media. We often look online and see others and admire their lives that it lowers self-esteem and can bring a variety of mental health problems.

ii. Tech can bring a sense of isolation. We no longer pick up calls, we only text. Studies have found proof of this, that individuals that use social media much more actively than those who don't, have a higher sense of self-isolation.

iii. Tech can be harmful because of time, also. It can be pretty distracting and often takes time for me to get back on track, to stop procrastinating.

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Dopamine is definitely real. It is not a parent conspiracy, as it has been scientifically proven. While we don’t notice it, we do feel it and it gives us an enhanced sense of joy, which is fabricated. It can be really hard to ignore and attaches us to our devices more, which thus worsens mental health. It's like an endless cycle.
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

i. By using any device (s) of any kind, someone is empowered. Now they have responsibility and power and can either use their power to inflict harm or spread positivity. We often see wrondoing, when there are instances of cyberbullying, sexting, etc. Through these tiny devices, we have an immense amount of power that goes both unnoticed and is a huge disadvantage to both rural or underprivileged areas which do not have access or financial ability to gain access, and is used incorrectly for people who want to take advantage of others, or use these devices to do awful things.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

ii. We can often help others by sharing our devices or possibly financing certain products that someone we care about is unable to access.

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

iii. Yes! Definitely. There are a lot of set rules that make it difficult for there to be fair allocation of devices, and so not everybody is empowered. At DNHS, there are many students who cannot get a device of their own, and must use a chromebook in school everyday provided by the school. This exists all over the world, in underprivileged and rural areas, and strong adhesion to such rules.

**5.3 Notes: Computing Bias**
* How bias exists in computing divisions: Netflix?
* * Lots of data from viewers
* Explicit data: thumbs, name, add, etc. + implicit: what watched, binged, style of show
* Bias
* * Netflix exclusives featured ahead of most
* * Computing innovations reflect existing human biases into algorithms or in the data used by innovation
* * Programmers shld take action to reduce algorithmic bias for computing innovations to combat existing human biases
* * Biases embedded in all software (unintentional/intentional)
* * Call of duty → doesn’t block ppl to play game, but geared for teens
* * Casual: sugary things; certain demographic
* * Facebook vs insta vs snap vs tiktok
* * * Tiktok: geared to ppl who like fast vids
* * * Facebook: only for boomers


**5.4 notes: Crowdsourcing**
* how ppl participate in problem-solving processing (crowdsourcing)
* -public data sets:
* --> kaggle: vizualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning
* * --> competitions, notebooks, etc.
* * --> places to house code and manipulate it
* --> google public datasets: freee for first terabyte, all in one package (Big Query and SQL)
* Data.gov
* --> US Govt. Data
* --> agriculture, energy, water, health
* Local Govt
* --> keep them accountable
* --> find solutions in the communisty
Distributed Computing
* --> donate spare computing power to help calculations
* folding@home - Stanford
* --> protein folding 
* --> misfolding is a problem
* --> bits sent to computers that volunteer to process something and it is sent back for research
* BOINC - UC Berkeley
* --> variety of projects
* --> math, astrophysics, minecraft
* minecraft: seeds sent, seeds will develop a world, and it is sent back
* sci, using citizen science, solves problems
* not official scientists, but citizens, can help contribute relavent data
* innovations w/ crowdsourcing:
* 1. spotify; collaborative playlists (many ppl part of it), or algorithm (offers new music to u based on listening activity), meta-data write-in (writing descriptions for the songs, approved by others)
* 2. crowdfunding
* * Kickstarter where ppl pitch ideas and money is given to develop the idea (Shark Tank but with millions of ppl)
* * IndieGoGo; philanthropic/nonprofit programs
* 3. Blockchain; cryptocurrency, secures concert tickets for example, through decentralized computer network
* Crowdsourcing: information taken from a lot of people, business, social causes with funding


**_Github Pages Action Responses Week 1_**

**Thoughts on the HP Video**
* I thought it was really interesting. I found it really upsetting, but the fact that those who were developing it were probably white people, or the main audience at the time during development was white, could have definitely influenced why the product was only targeted at a certain group. 

**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

* I definitely do not think this was intentional. While there are obvious personal biases, as a team developing something for the world, it would have not been in their best interest to create something simply for the white audience only.

**How do you think this happened?**

* I think this is because the developers were white, so they did not think about other races or demographics.

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

* Yes! It is harmful. This may not have been intentional, but the lack of attention to detail or proper care is harmful. It promotes the idea that technology is designed only for white people, and it is important to be inclusive so that other groups of people or races are able to use technology in the same manner.

**Should it be corrected?**

* Definitely! There should be improvement because not only is it unfair, it is discriminatory, and harmful. 

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

* I think it would be important to put more diverse individuals in the developing process. More points of view will come out to avoid such a big discrepancy. Creating a facial recognition software that doesn't discriminate based on race would also be helpful so that this issue doesn't arise again. 

**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

* A crowdsource idea we could do is to help initiate professional connections. We could have CSP students and adults, as well as guest speakers who are in a certain field themselves, come in and communicate. We can have students experiment and work together in things they are confused on, continuing to challenge themselves. Through this, we can generate solutions to problems and generate brainstorming, which can ultimately lead us to a lot of societal improvement.

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

* We can help initiate professional connections, and do the same thing as before, but instead have a variety of subjects other than computer science. We can have groups like chemistry, biology, mathematics, astrophysics, etc. We can thus generate audiences and brainstorming in all of these groups, which can combine to create solutions to a lot of problems, or at least, probable solutions.


_**5.5 Notes**_

**5.5 Daily Video 1: Legal/Ethical Concerns**
* intellectual property: work/inventions where people have rights; easil accessed
* ^ raises concerns about ownership
* Copyright: when you create something, you own it. It protects your property, unless you give permission. It is plagiarism if people use code for their own. It is legal if used with Creative Commons, open source, or open access.
* Creative Commons: free licenses that can tell others how you want them to use your creation. Regulates freedom with creativity.
* open source: programs made freely for anyone and redistributed and modified. encourages collaboration.
* open acceess: online research with no restricts on access/use.
* cite creates, and give credit. 
* Some use other's work for harmful things, unfortunately. Legal and ethical concerns arise.
* Digital divide: unequal distribution of access to tech.

_**5.6 Notes**_

**5.6 DV 1: Safe Computing**
* PII; personal identifiable info. Critical/important information to identity. 
* used to steal identity, funds, or for impersonation.
* PII in search engines, locations, search history, etc.
* PII enhances online experience but can also be exploited
* Google/ISP know information, so they can recommend certain sites to you based on what you are looking for.
* tracking of online behavior also from travel sites/firms
* detail control about individuals are on the internet
* * difficult to get rid of inromation
* * can deduce private information, used harmfully

**5.6 DV 1: Safe Computing**
* authentication protects devices (authorized access)
* passwords, multi-factor authentication
* factors; the more secure, the harder to guess
* * 10/more characters, symbols, numbers, not generic
* authentication
* * passwords, biometric data, what you have/cards, etc.
* * ex: computer; password, then identity verification, then fingerprint, etc.
* viruses/malware
* * virusese copy themselves, gain access to systems, bypass multifactor authentication
* * infiltrate systems by posing as legit programs, takes over operations
* run virus scans!!
* legit data should stay uncompromised through encryption (encoding data) which is then decoded
* encryption: symmetric, asymmetric: one key in symmetric for both encryption and decryption, two keys in asymmetric (public/private for encoding/decoding)
* * sender doesn't need receiver's private key for encryption, but receiver's private key is REQUIRED for decryption

**5.6 DV 3: Safe Computing**
* internet is very important
* used for bad things, too
* ^risks to personal safety, identity
* phishing: tricking ppl into giving PII
* phishing emails look trustworthy, but you click on links or open attachments that give PII
* clicking on these links --> installs virus, fake websites, installing keyloggers
* keyloggers: ppl track keytrokes to gain information
* rogue access point: wireless network that gives unauthorized access to secure networks

_**Github Pages Actions**_

**When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.**

* Open access, creative commons license, and open source allow for people to use other creative works freely. Github also allows for an MIT license so that we can distribute code freely and to make closed source versions. 

**Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.**

 * We chose az GPL license b/c we want to allow people to access our work and modify it for its improvement. I chose a Creative Commons v1. Universal licencse in order to safely give legal access to my code to share with others. 

**Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**

* We have seen data bases with teachers/students information, so we plan to use authentication factors to ensure that that information is safe.  

**What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**

* I'm a little bit upset now that I've learned more about it, but I know that that is part of having a digital footprint. It is important to stay as safe as possible. I feel that I hhad some exposure to PII becuase I worked a little bit on the database last trimester. 

**Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**

*  A bad password has a lack of generic words, symbols, numbers, capitals, etc. which makes the password weak
*  A good password has a mix of letters, capitals, numbers, symbols, characters, etc. in order to add strength to the password
* Multifactor authentication or biometric scans along with passwords ensure more security. Fingerprint and facial recognition are also used to assist in authenticatiion. Security phrases that only the person who's account it is, knows the answer to those questions also helps with authetication and protection of privacy. 

**Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**

* encryption: 
* * one key (private key) in symmetric for both encryption and decryption,
* * two keys in asymmetric (public/private for encoding/decoding), in which sender doesn't need receiver's private key for encryption, but receiver's private key is REQUIRED for decryption

**Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**

* Database and server encryption, in which we encrypted our databases for security instead of leaving them in plain text. Encryption is also used when using certbot to make the website secure or add the 's' in https. 

**Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**

* Where a suspicious email appears to be from a bank or another supposedly trustworthy website, but they lure individuals with a link which installs a virus on a computer or reveals a lot of PII. Other phishing techniques are posing as real organizations and asking people to click on links for prizes.
